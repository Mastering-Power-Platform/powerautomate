Pre-requisites for __Mastering Power Automate__ labs.

## Pre-req

Setting up the experimental designer & activate your Power Apps developer plan

### Find your lab environment details
- [List of usernames for this course](https://edumscloud-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/siddharthdwn_edumscloud_onmicrosoft_com/ETGAI96lJSJJvabhN1Ni6ioBrteRjWJ-TVz3JCqhLJ0MXg?e=uOBXt8)
- Please type your name against the chosen username. Please use the same username throughout this course to maintain consistency.


### Activate your developer license (Optional, as this license is already activated for lab users)
The Microsoft365 license provides a Standard Power Apps and Power Automate license which is good enough for most labs. However, some labs require a Premium connector; the Power Apps Developer Plan gives you access to __Premium__ features of the product for free. The main restriction of the Developer license is that flows and applications created with this license cannot be used in production.
Follow the instruction described here [Sign up for Power Apps Developer Plan - Power Apps | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/plan) to activate this license.
A dedicated Power Platform environment will be generated as part of this activation, and this is where you will do the exercises.
